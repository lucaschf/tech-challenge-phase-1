"""This module defines the Value Objects used within the domain.

Value Objects are immutable entities characterized by their attributes or state, rather than
their identity.
They encapsulate a set of attributes and related behavior
that form a conceptual whole within the domain model.

This module provides a declaration of such objects,
promoting code consistency and domain integrity.
